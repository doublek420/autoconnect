Description: This module helps in automatic client-server socket connection setup for networked applications.
        
        I wrote this module a while ago (5+ years) and though it would be handy
        for others. Its a handy auto-socket connection module. I used it
        originally in a internet cafe management system. The client app installed
        on the PC would start the receiver. It would then wait for the server
        to broadcast its URL and on receiving it connect and do its business.
        
        I've recently had call to want to do this type of thing again so I thought
        I'd dust this code off and make into a proper project. I'll release the
        code I've got first the improve it as I start using again.
